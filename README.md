# Malaria-Cell-Image-classification

Image classsification task using Malaria Cell Image dataset available on Kaggle

1. First approach is done using the standard convolutional layers using dropout, batch normalization.(The code is inspired from the internet)
2. In the second approach transfer learning is used to classify the images using ResNet50
